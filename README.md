**For what purpose was the dataset created?**  
The Maneno Yetu corpus was created to address the lack of large-scale, diverse, and openly available Swahili language datasets suitable for foundational NLP tasks. It supports the development of transformer-based models like SLFM and enables both practical applications and theoretical linguistic analysis.

**Who created the dataset?**  
The dataset was created by researchers affiliated with the University of Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) and Hanyang University (South Korea):
- Chaddy Anthony Zawuya  
- Alfred Malengo Kondoro
- Diana Rwegasira  
- Juma H. Lungo

**What—if any—licenses apply to the dataset?**  
The dataset is released under an open license and is publicly available via GitHub:

**What tasks or research does it support?**  
It supports a wide range of tasks:
- Language modeling  
- Part-of-speech tagging  
- Sentiment and emotion classification  
- Named entity recognition  
- Abusive language detection  
- Longitudinal linguistic analysis
